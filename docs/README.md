# CiMplicity Splunk App Documentation

Welcome to the CiMplicity Splunk App documentation! This directory contains all the documentation you need to understand, build, and contribute to the project.

## ðŸ“š Documentation Index

### Getting Started
- **[Quick Start Guide](QUICK_START.md)** - Get up and running in minutes
- **[Build Guide](BUILD_GUIDE.md)** - Comprehensive build and development documentation

### For Developers
- **Quick Start**: For immediate development setup
- **Build Guide**: Deep dive into build processes, CI/CD, and troubleshooting

### For DevOps/CI/CD
- **Build Guide**: Contains detailed CI/CD pipeline documentation
- **GitHub Actions**: Located in `../.github/workflows/splunk-app-ci.yml`

## ðŸ”§ Project Overview

**CiMplicity** is a Splunk app that helps with data onboarding and CIM (Common Information Model) mapping. The project is structured as a monorepo with multiple packages:

### Key Components
- **React UI Components** (`ci-mplicity-home`): Frontend interface built with Splunk React UI
- **Splunk App Core** (`cim-plicity`): Backend Python scripts and Splunk configuration
- **Automated CI/CD**: GitHub Actions for build, test, and deployment

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React, Splunk React UI, Webpack, Babel
- **Backend**: Python, Splunk REST APIs
- **Configuration**: UCC Framework (Universal Configuration Console)
- **Build Tools**: Lerna (monorepo), Yarn, Node.js
- **Quality**: Jest (testing), ESLint (linting), Prettier (formatting)
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions, Splunk AppInspect

## ðŸš€ Quick Commands

```bash
# Install UCC framework
pip install splunk-add-on-ucc-framework

# First time setup
yarn run setup

# Generate UCC components
ucc-gen --source ucc-app -o build/
cp -R build/cim-plicity/* packages/cim-plicity/src/main/resources/splunk/

# Build for production
yarn run build

# Start development
yarn run start

# Run tests
yarn run test

# Check code quality
yarn run lint
```

## ðŸ“¦ Build Outputs

After building, you'll find:
- **Production App**: `packages/cim-plicity/stage/` (ready for Splunk installation)
- **Demo/Development**: `packages/ci-mplicity-home/demo/`
- **Distribution Packages**: `dist/*.tar.gz` (from CI/CD)

## ðŸ”„ CI/CD Pipeline

Every code push triggers our automated pipeline:

1. **Build** â†’ Compiles and packages the Splunk app
2. **Test** â†’ Runs unit tests and code quality checks  
3. **AppInspect** â†’ Validates against Splunk standards
4. **Release** â†’ Publishes releases for version tags

## ðŸ†˜ Getting Help

### Common Issues
- **Build fails**: Try clearing cache with `yarn cache clean && rm -rf node_modules && yarn install`
- **Tests fail**: Check individual test output with `yarn test -- --verbose`
- **CI/CD issues**: Review GitHub Actions logs and AppInspect reports
